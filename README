Requirements
    - gphoto2
    - ptpcam (part of chdk)
    - python-flickr

defaults:
    debug: False
    archivedir: ~/myphotobooth
    numpics: 4
    useFlickr: False

To override defaults create /etc/myphotobooth.conf
[myphotobooth]
debug: True
archivedir: /home/detiber/firstbirthday
numpics: 4
useFlickr: True
flickr_api_key: XXXXXXXX
flickr_api_secret: XXXXXX
flickr_set: myphotobooth

Current TODO
============
- Display pictures after downloaded briefly in order
- Figure out way to deselect the go button after run is complete
- Create photostrip
    - merge pictures with template
    - Display photostrip until ready for next shoot
- archive photostrip
- Add asynchronous operation for upload tasks (flickr/email) so that there is not as much a delay between uses
    - show pictures for a set amount of time, and then show photostrip for a set amount of time before next use
    - possibly set to show picture shortly after taking, rinse and repeat until number of photos wanted for strip is taken, instead of firing pictures in succession
    - would be great to have a live view of the cam, or at least the review type picture from camera instead of having to wait for download
- email pictures and photostrip to user if emailAddress entered
    - http://docs.python.org/library/email-examples.html 
    - also, for my use, will need to setup relay to ISP mail host on 
      local smtp server
- Add to config file parsing
    - flickr bool
    - flickr acct info
    - email from address
    - email relay info
    - banner graphic
    - photostrip template

Future TODO
===========
- Fix camera hangs (maybe requiring migrating from ptpcam to chdkptp)
- Config file option for flickr visibility (currently forces is_public)
- GUI for flickr api approval
    - currently command line based
- Better Error Checking/handling
    - flickr api
    - others
- Logging
    - fix stdout/stderr logging with flickrapi included
    - add log based logging
- Add support for other tetherable cameras
- Add support for other photosharing sites
- Code cleanup
    - break up into modules
    - Fix ugly hacks 
    - Better checking around config file parsing
    - refactor so that actions like email, flickr are using a plugin type architecture
- Package
    - Script to create RPM/Deb package
- Makefile
    - targets for installing, cleaning, packaging
- submit to fedora repo
    - may need to package ptpcam as a prerequisite
