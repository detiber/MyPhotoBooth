Requirements
    - gphoto2
    - ptpcam (part of chdk)
    - python-flickr

defaults:
    debug: False
    archivedir: ~/myphotobooth
    numpics: 4
    useFlickr: False

To override defaults create /etc/myphotobooth.conf
[myphotobooth]
debug: True
archivedir: /home/detiber/firstbirthday
numpics: 4
useFlickr: True
flickr_api_key: XXXXXXXX
flickr_api_secret: XXXXXX
flickr_set: myphotobooth

Current TODO
============
- Need to factor out the code that takes process the pictures from the MyPhotoBoothApp class so that we aren't overwriting the variables to indicate that things have been uploaded, emailed, leave the code in place to display pictures though
- Make sure that files display in order
- If no picture is available, display something that shows loading, etc so that we don't show a broken image
- Figure out way to deselect the go button after run is complete
- Create photostrip
    - merge pictures with template
    - Display photostrip until ready for next shoot
- archive photostrip
- Add asynchronous operation for upload tasks (flickr/email) so that there is not as much a delay between uses
- Make imageWindow display of pictures parallel with the processing of photostrip and uploading, emailing and archiving tasks
- Make sure email task also includes links to flickr photos
- show pictures for a set amount of time, and then show photostrip for a set amount of time before next use
- possibly set to show picture shortly after taking, rinse and repeat until number of photos wanted for strip is taken, instead of firing pictures in succession
- would be great to have a live view of the cam, or at least the review type picture from camera instead of having to wait for download
- email pictures and photostrip to user if emailAddress entered
    - http://docs.python.org/library/email-examples.html 
    - also, for my use, will need to setup relay to ISP mail host on 
      local smtp server
- Add to config file parsing
    - flickr bool (Fix)
    - email from address
    - email relay info
    - banner graphic
    - photostrip template
    - how long to display each image

Future TODO
===========
- Fix camera hangs (maybe requiring migrating from ptpcam to chdkptp)
- Config file option for flickr visibility (currently forces is_public)
- GUI for flickr api approval
    - currently command line based
    - popup is defined in myphotobooth.glade
    - should move ConfigFile parsing to MyPhotoBoothApp class (That way FlickrUploader is initiated after the gtk builder is created)
- Better Error Checking/handling
    - flickr api
    - others
- Logging
    - fix stdout/stderr logging with flickrapi included
    - add log based logging
- Add support for other tetherable cameras
- Add support for other photosharing sites
- Code cleanup
    - break up into modules
    - Fix ugly hacks 
    - Better checking around config file parsing
    - refactor so that actions like email, flickr are using a plugin type architecture
- Package
    - Script to create RPM/Deb package
- Makefile
    - targets for installing, cleaning, packaging
- submit to fedora repo
    - may need to package ptpcam as a prerequisite
